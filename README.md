Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to create a custom String class in the form of a singly linked list of characters. This will increase your familiarity with classes, linked lists, and how to overload existing methods. As a result of this assignment, you will learn how to design and create a linked list data structure, and understand in which situations linked lists can be used. The knowledge you gain from this assignment will help you later in this course, other Computer Science courses you might take in the future, and in the Computer Science industry.

Task:

Implement the class SLLString using the SLLString.h file [Download]Download [Download]
Run the program with the help of the Main.cpp file [Download]Download [Download]
To Do:

Download the SLLString.h and Main.cpp files
Create a singly linked list where each node holds a single char
Write the following Constructors:
One with an empty parameter list
One with a string parameter
One with an SLLString parameter (copy constructor)
Write a destructor
Overload the following operators: 
=
+=
[] (for getting specific characters)
<< (must be done as a friend method)
Write the following helper methods:
One that returns the length of an SLLString
One that returns the index of the first occurrence of substring, and returns - 1 if not found
One that erases all occurrences of a selected character from the SLLString
Submit all the relevant .cpp and .h files to Canvas
